# React-Backbone Demo

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have node installed. I recommend using brew.

2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` from the project root



## Running App

``` 
# This will launch a watchify process that will rebuild js/bundle.js on every file save to a .js or .jsx file.
npm run start 
```


from a new terminal process at the same project directory:
``` open index.html ```


## Running Tests
``` 
npm run test 
```


## Backlog
- Add React component stubbing
- Use Sinon for more elegant Backbone model stubs
- Get React Chrome Dev Tools Working
- Enable code coverage (mochify-istanbul) for jsx
- hook up mochify to selenium web driver
